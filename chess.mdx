## Motivation

At this point in my life, I know myself pretty well. I knew if I set out to create a new board game from scratch it would end up taking me weeks or even months to finish. I decided I needed to recreate a game that already had it's rules set in stone. Chess was the obvious answer because it's straight forward, and logically easy to code, but also because of it's *cool* factor. 

In recent years chess has had a resurgence in popularity with online chess leading the charge. I might suck at chess but I knew I could bring my own version of the game to the table.

## Logic

The first thing I did was create all of the logic for the board. Maybe I could have used some 3rd party library but where's the fun in that? Initially I thought this was a great time to experiment  with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). Unfortunately, I quickly remembered why I like functional coding and rewrote most of what I had already done. Luckily, little work was lost because this was within the first few hours.

By the end of the day I had a functioning (sort of) game of chess. I was confident that I was ready to move things to the world of *3D*.

## 3D

### The pieces

Now that I was ready to porting things over to React Three Fiber I headed to[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) and downloaded the 3D chess piece models. I have a very basic understanding of how to use Blender but I definitely couldn't model them myself. There was one minor setback -- all the pieces were together in one file. So before I could use them, I had to separate each piece into it's own `.glb` file and update their origin points. Updating the origin points was necessary so that each models `(0, 0)` point was at the bottom-center (aka the point that will be touching the board).

### The Board

The board itself was very easy to implement. I created it by mapping through an array and rendering 64 individual cubes. This way it was easy to check which cube the player has clicked on.

<CodeSnippet
  title="Creating the board"
  language="tsx"
  code={`<group key={\`$\{j}-$\{i}\`}>
  <TileComponent
    color={bg}
    position={[j, 0.25, i]}
    onClick={handleClick}
    canMoveHere={canMoveHere?.newPosition ?? null}
  />
  <MeshWrapper key={pieceId} {...props}>
    {tile.piece?.type === \`pawn\` && <PawnModel />}
    {tile.piece?.type === \`rook\` && <RookComponent />}
    {tile.piece?.type === \`knight\` && <KnightComponent />}
    {tile.piece?.type === \`bishop\` && <BishopComponent />}
    {tile.piece?.type === \`queen\` && <QueenComponent />}
    {tile.piece?.type === \`king\` && <KingComponent />}
  </MeshWrapper>
</group>`}
/>

### Making it Pretty

Now that everything was working as intended I wanted to make everything a bit more polished. I love lighting effects so I used a red point light to mark the piece that is currently selected. It was functional and looked pretty nice.

{ /* {{ INSERT demo of light with on/off switch }} */}

I also added more ambient lighting and updated the textures. I was going to set the game inside of a skybox but opted for a gradient background instead. I did however use a cubemap of a sunset to give the 3d models more realistic reflections. This is also what gave them the purple/pink tint.

### Animations

There are two good libraries for handling animations in R3F. The first is Framer Motion 3D, and the second is React Spring. I started off by using Framer because I'd used it in the past but partway through I actually starting doing a lot of the animations with React Spring instead. I feel like React Spring's API is just slightly easier to use.

{ /* {{ INSERT comparison of two libraries code }} */}

Using React Spring I added animations to everything from moving the pieces to the color of the tiles changing when you click on them.

## Multiplayer

Socket IO was a technology that I hadn't yet used so I was excited to try it out since real-time interactions between users seemed really cool.

It was actually easy to set it up because of Next.js's "pages router". I created one `socket.ts` file under `src/pages/api`. Sadly, with the new "app router" I'm not sure if it's still possible to use Socket.io with Next.js. So take that into consideration if you're planning on using sockets. Using socket.io also means that you cannot use Vercel to deploy your site since it uses edge functions to serve the site instead of a dedicated server. I had to use Heroku to host the site but you could also use Fly.io or Render.
### Events

Obviously, I needed to allow players to join their own rooms unless I only wanted everyone playing together on one board... could be chaotic. 

<GithubCodeSnippet
  link="https://github.com/joshwrn/3d-chess/blob/65b285289afa7891f1d39a33c4a6543de6e45ef6/src/server/joinRoom.ts"
  lines={[1, 20]}
/>

I also created Socket.io events for making moves,  player's camera position, fetching players in a room, and sending messages.

### State

I opted to use Zustand for state management. It's listed on the R3F homepage as  "Bear necessities for state management in React." If you wanted a more atomic approach to state management you could use Jotai or [Atom.io](https://atom.io.fyi).  

{ /* {{ INSERT codesnippet of https://github.com/joshwrn/3d-chess/blob/65b285289afa7891f1d39a33c4a6543de6e45ef6/src/state/game.ts }} */}

One of the great things about Zustand  is the ability to get state outside of react. It's as simple as

<CodeSnippet
  code={`const { id, username } = usePlayerState.getState()`}
  language="typescript"
  title="Getting state outside of react"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>


This is important when you need to fetch state inside of socket events on the client.

## Conclusion

This was a really fun project it and it took me less than one week to complete. I'd recommend creating random one off projects just for fun. You end up learning a lot and have something to show off at the end!
