## Motivation

One of the most important aspects of working on a large React application is being able to debug the state. Recoil is a great library for managing state in React applications, but it can be difficult to debug the state without a visual interface. That's why I created Recoil Devtools.

## Getting the State

Luckily, Recoil has an easy way to get the current state of all atoms/selectors. From there we can create an array from the nodes.

<CodeSnippet  
title="Creating an array of nodes from the Recoil snapshot"
language="tsx"
code={`
const List: FC = () => {
  const snapshot = useRecoilSnapshot()

  useMemo(() => {
    const list = Array.from(snapshot.getNodes_UNSTABLE())
    // do something with the list
  }, [snapshot])

  snapshot.retain()
`}
  />

In my case, I wanted to combine nodes that belonged to the same Atom/Selector Family. That way, I could keep them grouped together in the UI.

<CodeSnippet
language="tsx"
title="Grouping nodes by Family"
highlightedLines={[[6, 30]]}
code={`
const List: FC = () => {
  const snapshot = useRecoilSnapshot()

  useMemo(() => {
    const list = Array.from(snapshot.getNodes_UNSTABLE())
    const families = new Map()
    const temp: Item[] = []
    list.map((item) => {
      const splitItem = item.key.split(\`__\`)
      if (splitItem.length > 1) {
        const key = splitItem[0]
        if (!families.has(key)) {
          let familyType = \`AtomFamily\`
          if (item.key.includes(\`__selectorFamily\`)) {
            familyType = \`SelectorFamily\`
          }
          families.set(key, {
            items: [],
            type: familyType,
          })
        }
        families.get(key).items.push(item)
      } else {
        temp.push({ type: \`Atom\`, item })
      }
    })
    for (const [key, value] of families) {
      temp.push({ type: value.type, item: { key, items: value.items } })
    }
    setAllAtoms(temp)
  }, [snapshot])

  snapshot.retain()
`}
/>

## Creating a Recursive Tree

Once we have the list of nodes, we need to map through each piece of state and create a tree. This tree will be recursive, meaning that it will continue to create nodes until it reaches a primitive value.

For example `const state = [1, 2, 3]` would be represented as: 

<CodeSnippet
language="json"
showLineNumbers={false}
code={`state: [
    1,
    2,
    3
]`}
/>

We map through each item in the array and create a new node for each item. If the item is an array, we recursively call the function to create a new node. If the item is a primitive value, we display the value.

Here's the code for handling arrays. I had to handle Sets, Maps, and Objects as well. But the concept is the same.

<CodeSnippet  
title="Creating an array of nodes from the Recoil snapshot"
language="tsx"
highlightedLines={[20, 36]}
code={`const RecursiveTree: FC<{ contents: unknown; branchName: string }> = ({
  contents,
  branchName,
}) => {
  const [isOpen, toggleItemOpen] = useRecoilState(openItemsState)

  const createTree = (branch: unknown, dir: string) => {
    // handle array
    if (branch instanceof Set || branch instanceof Map) {
      branch = Array.from(branch)
    }

    if (branch instanceof Array) {
      return (
        <>
          <Mark>[</Mark>
          {branch.map((item: unknown, index: number) => {
            return (
              <Box border="gray" key={dir + index}>
                {createTree(item, \`\${dir}/\${index}\`)}
                {index < (branch as Array<unknown>).length - 1 && <Mark>,</Mark>}
              </Box>
            )
          })}
          <Mark>]</Mark>
        </>
      )
    }

    // non-object, non-array. aka is a "primitive"
    return <Primitive data={branch} />
  }

  return (
    <span style={{ paddingLeft: \`12px\` }}>
      {createTree(contents, branchName)}
    </span>
  )
}

export default RecursiveTree`}
  />

## Styling

Once we have the tree, we can display it in a React component. I created the UI from scratch using styled-components. In retrospect, this might have been a good opportunity to use a UI library. But I do enjoy front-end work, so oh well.

### Syntax Highlighting

The recursive tree always ends with a primitive value. This could be a string, number, boolean, or null. Here's how I handled syntax highlighting for each of the different data types.

<CodeSnippet
language="tsx"
title="Primatives"
code={`const Primitive: FC<{ data: unknown }> = ({ data }) => {
  if (data === null) {
    return <Null>null</Null>
  }
  if (data === undefined) {
    return <Undefined>undefined</Undefined>
  }
  if (data instanceof Date) {
    return <String>{data.toString()}</String>
  }
  if (typeof data === \`string\`) {
    return <String>{\`"\${data}"\`}</String>
  }
  if (typeof data === \`number\`) {
    return <Number>{data}</Number>
  }
  if (typeof data === \`boolean\`) {
    return <Boolean>{data ? \`true\` : \`false\`}</Boolean>
  }
  return <Text>unknown</Text>
}
`}
/>

### Themes

I didn't need a library to do syntax highlighting. I just used styled-components to style the text based on the type of data. With the help of Github Copilot, I was able to quickly recreate 10 popular themes. Here's an example of the "Github Light" theme.

<CodeSnippet
language="tsx"
title="Github Light Theme"
code={`
{
  "Github Light": {
    "key": "#d73a49",
    "string": "#6f42c1",
    "number": "#005cc5",
    "boolean": "#005cc5",
    "null": "#005cc5",
    "mark": "#586069",
    "link": "#0366d6",
    "text": "#24292e",
    "primaryText": "#24292e",
    "faintText": "#586069",
    "headerBackground": "#f6f8fa",
    "faintOutline": "#e1e4e8",
    "background": "#ffffff",
    "iconBackground": "#e7e7e7"
  }
}`}
/>

## Conclusion
This was just a brief overview of how Recoil Devtools works. There are many more features that I didn't cover. If you're interested in taking a deeper dive, check out the [Repo](https://github.com/joshwrn/recoil-devtools/) on Github!

This was a fun project to work on. It was a great way to learn more about Atom based state. If you use Recoil in your projects, I highly recommend trying out Recoil Devtools. I use them every day at work and they have saved me countless hours of debugging time.
