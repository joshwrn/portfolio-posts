## Motivation

The initial purpose of this site wasn't to create an AI-powered drawing app. It was meant to get some experience with an infinite canvas, element snapping, and svg arrows (those lines that connect different nodes/elements). Eventually, I decided to expand the project to include AI-powered drawings.

Personally, I don't believe purely AI-generated art is really "artwork", but I definitely think from a technical standpoint, it's very impressive. The point of this project was to create a fun expirement with AI and to learn more about how it works. It is not meant to be a "finished" product nor is it meant to be used in a professional setting.

## Windows

The most important component of the app is the window. There are two window types: generators and generations. Let's break down both of them.

### Generators

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db4ddmnhg/image/upload/v1727570079/projects/scribble-ai/generator_wwurdm.png" subText={`A generator window.`} width={1117} height={760} />

Generator windows are the main window that users interact with. They are used to create new artworks. They contain the following components:

- The canvas
  - The canvas is where the user draws their artwork.
- The prompt
  - The prompt is the subject of the artwork. A prompt will be randomly generated for each artwork, but the user can also input their own prompt.
- The randomize button
  - The randomize button will randomly generate a new prompt for the artwork.

### Generations

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db4ddmnhg/image/upload/v1727570080/projects/scribble-ai/generation_z3ckqa.png" subText={`A generation window.`} width={1115} height={787} />

Generation windows are branches of the generator windows. They are used to generate new artworks based on the prompts of the parent artworks. They contain the following components:

- The output image
  - The output image is the final artwork that is generated based on the prompts of the parent artworks.
- The activate button
  - The activate button is used to decide which generation window to draw to. Each generator can only have one active generation window at a time.
- The modifier prompt
  - The modifier prompt is used to decide the style of the subject/prompt of the artwork. The default modifier prompt is "watercolor", but the user can also input their own.

## Settings Nodes

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db4ddmnhg/image/upload/v1727570079/projects/scribble-ai/settings_m848xm.png" subText={`A settings window.`} width={800} height={547} />

Settings nodes are used to adjust the ai parameters of generations/generators they are connected to. The following settings are available:

- Inference steps
  - Inference steps is the number of steps the model will take to generate the artwork. A higher number will result in a more detailed artwork, but it will also take longer to generate.
- Guidance scale
  - Guidance scale is a value between 0 and 16 that determines how much the model should follow the prompt. A higher value will make the model more confident in its output.
- Strength
  - Strength is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how closely the generated artwork will match the sketch. A higher value gives the model more freedom to create the artwork.

## Connections

There are two types of connections, connections betweens generators and generations, and connections between settings nodes and generations/generators.

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db4ddmnhg/image/upload/v1727577169/projects/scribble-ai/connections.png" subText={`An example of multiple connections`} width={1640} height={1314} />

Generations can only be connected to one generator. Generators can be connected to multiple generations. Settings nodes can be connected to multiple generations/generators.

If a settings node is connected to a generator it will affect all of the branched generations. You can override the settings of a branched generation by directly connecting a settings node to it.

## AI

The AI is powered by [fal's](https://fal.ai/) optimized latency model. It's the same model that was used in [tldraw's](https://makereal.tldraw.com/) "make real". Using the model is as simple as passing in a prompt and a link (or base64) to your sketch. You can optionally pass your desired settings as well.

> NOTE: It's not uncommon for the AI to have a cold start. It may take up to a few minutes for the AI to generate the first image. It's also possible I've run out of tokens. If that happens you may need to clone it and enter your own API key.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project to work on! I learned a bit about AI, state managment, gestures, and html canvas. It's actually a pretty large project, so if you're interested in taking a deeper dive, check out the [repo](https://github.com/joshwrn/Scribble-AI/) on Github! Or test out the [demo](https://scribble-ai-joshw.vercel.app/).
