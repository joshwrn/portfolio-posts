## Motivation

The initial purpose of this site wasn't to create an AI-powered drawing app. It was meant to get some experience with an infinite canvas, element snapping, and svg arrows (those lines that connect different nodes/elements). Eventually, I decided to expand the project to include AI-powered drawings.

Personally, I don't believe purely AI-generated art is really "artwork", but I definitely think from a technical standpoint, it's very impressive. The point of this project was to create a fun expirement with AI and to learn more about how it works. It is not meant to be a "finished" product nor is it meant to be used in a professional setting.

## Components

### Windows

The most important component of the app is the window. There are three window types: the generator windows, the generation windows, and the settings windows. 

Generator windows are the main window that users interact with. They are used to create new artworks. They contain the following components:
- The canvas
  - The canvas is where the user draws their artwork.
- The prompt
  - The prompt is the subject of the artwork. A prompt will be randomly generated for each artwork, but the user can also input their own prompt.
- The randomize button
  - The randomize button will randomly generate a new prompt for the artwork.

Generation windows are branches of the generator windows. They are used to generate new artworks based on the prompts of the parent artworks. They contain the following components:
- The output image
  - The output image is the final artwork that is generated based on the prompts of the parent artworks.
- The activate button
