## Motivation

The initial purpose of this site wasn't to create an AI-powered drawing app. It was meant to get some experience with an infinite canvas, element snapping, and svg arrows (those lines that connect different nodes/elements). Eventually, I decided to expand the project to include AI-powered drawings.

Personally, I don't believe purely AI-generated art is really "artwork", but I definitely think from a technical standpoint, it's very impressive. The point of this project was to create a fun expirement with AI and to learn more about how it works. It is not meant to be a "finished" product nor is it meant to be used in a professional setting.

## Windows

The most important component of the app is the window. There are three window types: the generator windows, the generation windows, and the settings windows.

### Generators

Generator windows are the main window that users interact with. They are used to create new artworks. They contain the following components:

- The canvas
  - The canvas is where the user draws their artwork.
- The prompt
  - The prompt is the subject of the artwork. A prompt will be randomly generated for each artwork, but the user can also input their own prompt.
- The randomize button
  - The randomize button will randomly generate a new prompt for the artwork.

### Generations

Generation windows are branches of the generator windows. They are used to generate new artworks based on the prompts of the parent artworks. They contain the following components:

- The output image
  - The output image is the final artwork that is generated based on the prompts of the parent artworks.
- The activate button
  - The activate button is used to decide which generation window to draw to. Each generator can only have one active generation window at a time.
- The modifier prompt
  - The modifier prompt is used to decide the style of the subject/prompt of the artwork. The default modifier prompt is "watercolor", but the user can also input their own.

### Settings Windows

Settings windows are used to adjust the ai parameters of generations/generators they are connected to. They allow for adjusting the following parameters:

- Inference steps
  - Inference steps is the number of steps the model will take to generate the artwork. A higher number will result in a more detailed artwork, but it will also take longer to generate.
- Guidance scale
  - Guidance scale is a value between 0 and 16 that determines how much the model should follow the prompt. A higher value will make the model more confident in its output.
- Strength
  - Strength is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how closely the generated artwork will match the sketch. A higher value gives the model more freedom to create the artwork.
